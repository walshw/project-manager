Goals for this project:

1. Be able to record ideas for projects
2. Display them in a way that doesn't cause anxiety
3. Link projects with some method of checking status (link to file directory/link to git and open in web browser?)
4. Track whether a project is completed or not
5. Filtering on completion status and date created
